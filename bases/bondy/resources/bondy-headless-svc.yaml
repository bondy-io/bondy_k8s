# Headless service required by k8s statefulset and used to
# expose TCP/TLS endpoints use by Bondy nodes (peers) to form a cluster.
# For headless Services, a cluster IP is not allocated, kube-proxy does not
# handle these Services, and there is no load balancing or proxying done by the
# platform for them.
# As usual, bondy.default.svc.cluster.local will be created, but unlike with a
# standard service, doing a DNS lookup on this hostname provides all the
# addresses in the StatefulSet.
# In addition, entries are created for bondy-{N}.bondy.default.svc.cluster.
# local for  N in 0..NumberOfReplicas.
# Each of these resolves to the specific IP address of the replica index in the
# StatefulSet (Source: Kubernetes Up and Running by Hightower, Kelsey; Burns,
